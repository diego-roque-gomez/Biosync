# Biosync
Development of an EMG biofeedback system for muscle rehabilitation

## Project Context ##
Comunidad Moss I.A.P., an organization dedicated to supporting people with disabilities, commissioned the development of an EMG biofeedback system for muscle rehabilitation therapy.

Within three weeks, a fully functional analog electromyography system based on operational amplifiers was designed and prototyped. The final device was donated to the organization for clinical use.

## Technical Contributions ##
- Research on EMG system operation principles and signal characteristics
- Design of the analog signal conditioning circuit (amplification and filtering stages)
- PCB layout and manufacturing preparation
- PCB fabrication through JLCPCB and integration into the final prototype
